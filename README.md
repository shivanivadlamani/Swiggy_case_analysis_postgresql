This GitHub repository contains a case analysis of the popular food delivery service, Swiggy, using SQL. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of the company's performance, customer behavior, and restaurant trends. By utilizing SQL, we are able to extract and analyze large amounts of data from the company's database.

The analysis focuses on several key areas, including identifying customers who have never ordered, calculating the average price per dish, finding the top restaurants in terms of number of orders for a given month, and identifying restaurants with monthly sales above a certain threshold. Additionally, the analysis allows us to display all orders and order details for a specific customer within a specified date range, as well as identifying restaurants with the most repeat customers.

Another important aspect of the analysis is the examination of Swiggy's revenue growth. By analyzing month-over-month revenue data, we can gain insight into the company's overall financial performance and identify any trends or patterns that may be driving growth.

Lastly, the analysis aims to determine customers' most favored foods by analyzing their ordering history and identifying which dishes are most frequently ordered.

Overall, this case analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of Swiggy and the food delivery industry as a whole, and can be used to inform business strategies and decision-making.
